We are a team of senior environmentalists and social specialists who have conducted a great number of works for projects funded by the ADB, IFC, and World Bank as well as projects with the government of Vietnam and provincial authorities. Our team members used to work also for international consulting firms such as Arcadis, GHD, Arup, Jacobs thus we are very familiar with international standards and requirements.

We realize that some Clients sign contracts with international firms, however, those international firms again hire us to conduct most of the works and put significant high markup. Understanding this problem, we offer considerable lower fee in comparison with international firms but with the same of even higher quality since our team members understand the local context much more than foreigners.
