#### Our Story

**ASQ** team was found in 2016 by Dr. Nam Le with its starting services in infrastructure asset management and data analytics. The services have been grounded on frontier research works (Spin-off) conducted in Kyoto University and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich).

In 2020, ASQ formed a strategic partnership with EMAPTA (No. 1 BPO firm in Australia and the Philippines) to provide offshore staffing service in various sectors in Vietnam for International Clients.

In 2021, ASQ started to collaborate with the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh (UEH) to provide short training courses on data analytics and spatial analysis on GIS platforms for architects and engineers.
